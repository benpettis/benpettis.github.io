title: About Me
---

I enjoy using data science to try to understand various aspects of existence. I also like making music. I'm a singer-songwriter and play the ukulele, guitar, piano, and trumpet. One of my main goals in life is to use my knowledge to help improve the lives and/or reduce the suffering of others.

### My History

My personal life has been quite interesting. I've lived all over the country, from a farm in Georgia and a mansion in the Hollwood Hills to a Lakota Sioux reservation in South Dakota and a piece of cardboard in a parking lot while making a documentary on homelessness. At some point I will probably write my memoirs, as a few have told me I should. Professionally, I've worked in IT for over 20 years.
