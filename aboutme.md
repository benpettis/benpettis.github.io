I enjoy using data science to try to understand various aspects of existence. I also like making music. I'm a singer-songwriter and play the ukulele, guitar, piano, and trumpet.

### My History

My personal life has been quite interesting--I've lived all over the country, from a farm in Georgia to a mansion in the Hollwood Hills to an Indian reservation in South Dakota. At some point I will probably write my memoirs. Professionally, I've worked in IT for over 20 years.
